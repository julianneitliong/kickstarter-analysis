# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to take a large dataset with plenty of information and learn how to analyze the data to apply it to a real-life scenario using functions, statistics, and visualizations in Excel. With the use of these analytical tools, we were able to help Louise make an informed decision when it came to campaigning for plays.

## Analysis and Challenges
For this challenge, we were able to help Louise digest the data to information she can use. For the first deliverable, Louise was able to quickly see the outcomes of theater campaigns based on the month of launch. Using a Pivot chart allows Louise to quickly filter through the table and the line chart allows her to visualize the information. In addition, Louise is able to see the outcomes based on goals. The table created can help Louise determine, based on previous outcomes, how well her campaign may do based on the goals. The line chart can help Louise quickly see a visual for what goal ranges were most successful and which ranges were not. Based on these two analysis, she can make an informed decision on what time of year and what goal ranges will have the most favorable outcomes. 

The biggest challenge that I encountered was using the COUNTIFS function and having to manually type in the ranges for every outcome column. I felt that it was a very manual and time-consuming process and am unaware if there are simpler ways of getting the same output with the use of shortcuts. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Looking at the Pivot Table used in the Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date deliverable, more than 50% of outcomes were successful. With the use of the line chart, we can quickly see that May is usually a very successful month and the month of November has a low point for failed outcomes. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
In the Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals, using the line chart, we can see that the highest points occur in the largest goal ranges. Whereas the smaller goals have a higher percentage of success. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The only difficulty encountered was some of the work seemed manual where I would think there would be an Excel shortcut for it. For example, using the COUNTIFS function and setting the ranges, I would have to copy and paste the previous cell's equation into the new cell, and delete and replace the values. I had to do this for every cell in the Outcomes Based on Goals table.


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1) May was a very successful month for successful outcomes
2) there was no canceled data collected for October

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The larger the dollar amount range, the more likely the outcome will fail or be unsuccessful.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The data set's date range is from 2009 - 2017. This means the data is four years old and may not be reflective of recent times.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
I would be interested in looking at the demographics of those who have pledged to some of the campaigns to answer the question, "What audience is interested in plays" or also learning more about preferred generes.
